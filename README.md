## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- There is quite a lot of African restaurants in large American Cities and large numbers of this eateries do not have an automated system to collect customer orders. 
-Customers still have to queue for 10-15 mins to make a food order and another 30 minutes to get their ordered food
- This app provides an easy way for customers to make quick orders and give restaurant owners ample time to prepare the Order
- African delicacies are unique in terms of portions,sizes and types of food that patrons want and this front end project will build all this parameters into project
